<p>It's been more than three weeks since the midterm summary, and the project is now nearing completion.</p>
<p>Currently, all the original features of Blinken have been fully implemented in the QML version. The remaining tasks involve UI adjustments, testing, and fixing potential bugs.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on the following:</p>
<h2>Integrating Blinken's Logic</h2>
<p>The game logic of Blinken is handled by the <code>BlinkenGame</code> class from the original Blinken. The original code design is quite good, with most of the game logic encapsulated in this one class. The separation between the logic and the UI rendering is well done, so all I needed to do was connect the signals from this class in QML.</p>
<p>As for the audio playback in Blinken, the original code used the Phonon library, which is also open-source but does not support Android. Therefore, I replaced it with the <code>QtMultimedia</code> library, which provides cross-platform audio playback functionality.</p>
<h2>Android Build for KF6 Applications</h2>
<p>Some features of Blinken rely on libraries provided by the KF6 framework, such as <code>KF6I18n</code> and <code>KF6Config</code>. When cross-compiling to the Android platform, it's necessary to use the aarch64-linux versions of these libraries. If these libraries are not available on your system, you will encounter the following errors during compilation:</p>
<div class="language-bash" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="line">ld.lld: error: /usr/lib64/libKF6XmlGui.so.6.4.0 is incompatible with aarch64linux ld.lld: error: /usr/lib64/libKF6ConfigWidgets.so.6.4.0 is incompatible with aarch64linux </span>
<span class="line">……</span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre></div><p>However, the package manager on my Fedora distribution does not provide these versions. Compiling and installing them one by one from source is too cumbersome. On the advice of the community, I used <strong>Craft</strong> to handle cross-compilation.</p>
<p>For reference, here is the Craft tutorial: <a href="https://community.kde.org/Craft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Craft - KDE Community Wiki</a></p>
<p>Important note: If you encounter installation failures, make sure to clear all contents under <code>craft-kde-android</code> before trying again, as leftover files may cause the installation to fail.</p>
<p>When installing, choose the <code>Arm64</code> target architecture. If there are remnants from a previous failed installation, it may prevent the option to select the <code>ARM64</code> architecture.</p>
<p>If you encounter issues like "Permission denied," you’ll need to disable SELinux:</p>
<div class="language-bash" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="line"><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt-get</span> <span class="token function">install</span> selinux-utils </span>
<span class="line"><span class="token function">sudo</span> setenforce <span class="token number">0</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre></div><p>Additionally, note that in the virtual machine <code>invent-registry.kde.org/sysadmin/ci-images/android-qt67</code> provided by the community, the Java version is outdated, preventing the use of Gradle 8.6. You can either manually update the Java version in the docker or use an older version of Gradle.</p>
<p>To use Craft for building applications, you need to write a script called a <strong>Blueprint</strong>, which describes the libraries your application depends on. These scripts are relatively easy to write, and you can quickly get started by following the community documentation: <a href="https://community.kde.org/Craft/Blueprints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Craft/Blueprints - KDE Community Wiki</a>.</p>
<h2>Using KF6 Framework Libraries</h2>
<p>Some of the libraries originally used by Blinken are compatible with the Android platform, while others are not. By referring to the <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API Documentation</a>,  you can check which libraries are supported on Android. In Blinken, the following libraries are Android-compatible:</p>
<ul>
<li>CoreAddons</li>
<li>GuiAddons</li>
<li>I18n</li>
<li>XmlGui</li>
</ul>
<p>I needed to use these libraries in the QML version of Blinken.</p>
<p>The KF6 framework provides a convenient internationalization API, and the usage in QML is almost the same as in QWidget, which allowed me to directly reuse Blinken’s original multi-language support, saving a lot of time.</p>
<p>KConfig is used in Blinken to store high score information and settings. For the high scores, I needed to extract the <code>HighScoreManager</code> class from the original <code>HighScoreDialog</code> file, make some modifications, and then create a new high score interface in QML that connects the signals and slots of <code>HighScoreManager</code>. For the settings functionality, it’s as simple as registering a KConfig singleton in QML :</p>
<div class="language-C++" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="C++" data-title="C++"><pre class="language-C++"><code><span class="line">`qmlRegisterSingletonInstance&lt;blinkenSettings&gt;("org.kde.blinken", 1, 0, "BlinkenSettings", blinkenSettings::self());</span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre></div><p>KF6XmlGui was used in the original Blinken to create the About Blinken Page, About KDE Page, and Handbook Page. Although this library is Android-compatible, it is based on QWidget, while the main interface of Blinken is built with QML. Bringing in QWidget just for these pages didn't seem like a good idea. Luckily, for the Android platform, <code>kirigami-addons</code> provides this functionality. By incorporating it, I also brought in <code>Kirigami</code>, which helps optimize the UI.</p>
<p>After adding new dependencies, it’s important to modify the <code>.kde-ci.yml</code> file to support CI/CD.

<h2>Building QML Android Applications</h2>
<p>Qt Creator uses Gradle for project building. Once your project code is ready, select the Android kit for building in Qt Creator. Click build, and Qt Creator will generate Gradle configuration files for you. However, you may encounter errors such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Execution failed for task ':processDebugResources'.
A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.LinkApplicationAndroidResourcesTask$TaskAction
Android resource linking failed
aapt2 E 07-23 15:59:44 51907 51907 LoadedArsc.cpp:94] RES_TABLE_TYPE_TYPE entry offsets overlap actual entry data.
aapt2 E 07-23 15:59:44 51907 51907 ApkAssets.cpp:149] Failed to load resources table in APK '/home/zhy/Android/Sdk/platforms/android-35/android.jar'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because the current Gradle plugin version does not support android-35. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54152209/how-to-fix-execution-failed-for-task-appprocessdebugresources-android-re" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to fix "Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'. &gt; Android resource linking failed"[Android/Flutter] - Stack Overflow</a></p>
<p>To resolve this issue, you need to modify the Gradle configuration.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <code>/build/Qt_6_7_2_Clang_arm64_v8a-Debug/android-build</code> folder in your project.</p>
<p>Open the <code>build.gradle</code> file and locate the <code>dependencies</code> block:</p>
<div class="language-text" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="text" data-title="text"><pre class="language-text"><code><span class="line">dependencies {</span>
<span class="line">        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1'</span>
<span class="line">    }</span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre></div><p><code>com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1</code> refers to the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP). This default version is from 2022 and is quite outdated.</p>
<p>You can find the latest version here: <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.android.tools.build/gradle?repo=google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maven Repository: com.android.tools.build » gradle</a></p>
<p>Update the plugin version to a newer one, for example:</p>
<div class="language-text" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="text" data-title="text"><pre class="language-text"><code><span class="line">    dependencies {</span>
<span class="line">        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.4.1'</span>
<span class="line">    }</span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre></div><p>Additionally, when upgrading the plugin version, ensure compatibility with the <a href="https://gradle.org/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gradle version</a>.</p>
<p>Check the relationship between the Gradle and AGP versions here: <a href="https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Gradle plugin 8.5 release notes | Android Studio | Android Developers</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70545646/could-not-find-com-android-tools-buildgradle7-3-3-error-found-in-build-gradle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Could not find com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.3. error found in build.gradle file - Stack Overflow</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, you should use at least Gradle version 8.6 to support this plugin.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <code>./gradle/wrapper</code> folder and open the <code>gradle-wrapper.properties</code> file. This file defines the Gradle version used by the project.</p>
<p>Find the line:
<code>distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.3-bin.zip</code></p>
<p>Change it to:</p>
<p><code>distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.6-bin.zip</code></p>
<p>This update specifies that the project will use Gradle version 8.6.</p>
<p>After making these changes, click on build. It will automatically download the specified version of Gradle and then download the necessary Gradle plugins.</p>
<p>If successful, you can find the built APK at <code>./build/outputs/apk/debug</code>.</p>
<h2>Running and Installing APK</h2>
<p>In a Linux environment, you can use the adb command to install the APK on your Android device. Alternatively, you can use Qt Creator for one-click deployment.</p>
<p>After connecting your Android device via USB, use the adb command to install the APK:</p>
<div class="language-bash" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="line">adb <span class="token function">install</span> android-build-debug.apk</span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre></div><p>Make sure that your Android device has Developer Mode enabled. You can find specific instructions on how to enable Developer Mode based on your device model through an online search.</p>
<p>If you want to share the screen on your phone on PC, you can use scrcpy: <a href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genymobile/scrcpy: Display and control your Android device</a></p>

<p>It has been three weeks since the start of the OSPP project, during which my project has made some progress.</p>
<h2>Week 1, July 1st to July 7th</h2>
<p>In the first week of the project, with the help of my mentor, I first set up a suitable development environment and identified Blinken as the first application to be migrated for the project. In addition to this, I also set up this project's blog, which has now been included in KDE Planet.</p>
<p>Currently, I am using a development environment on a VirtualBox virtual machine running Fedora Workstation 40. With this setup, I can compile and build KDE applications and perform Qt development.</p>
<p>For building the KDE development environment, it is recommended to use <a href="https://develop.kde.org/docs/getting-started/building/kdesrc-build-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kdesrc-build</a> provided by KDE official, and it is also recommended to develop under KDE Neon system, which can be done using <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/More#Develop_in_a_Linux_container" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker</a> or <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Developing_in_a_virtual_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual machines</a></p>
<p>A straightforward method for setting up Qt Android development environment is to use [Qt Online Installer]((https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/get-and-install-qt.html#using-qt-maintenance-tool) and Qt Creator. After installing Qt Creator, navigate to Editing -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Devices -&gt; Android to select the necessary development kit. Qt Creator will automatically download the required SDK and NDK.</p>
<h2>Week 2, July 8th to July 14th</h2>
<p>Upon my mentor's suggestion, I developed a simple Tic-Tac-Toe QML game as a practice exercise. This game uses QML to create a simple interface and employs a C++ class to handle game logic, which will also be the architecture for the upcoming game migration.</p>
<p>The current features implemented in the game are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multilingual localization support</li>
<li>Unit testing capability</li>
<li>Cross-platform compatibility</li>
</ol>
<p>The Tic-Tac-Toe game is openly developed on KDE Invent: <a href="https://invent.kde.org/zhy/tictactoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hanyang zhang / TicTacToe · GitLab</a></p>
<p>Supporting localization for QML applications requires the use of Qt's localization tools such as lupdate and lrelease. However, since the project is built with CMake, Qt also provides corresponding CMake methods: <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtlinguist-cmake-qt-add-translations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qt_add_translations | Qt Linguist Manual</a></p>
<p>Additionally, I encountered some difficulties while building QML Android applications, as described here:
<a href="https://heeiya.github.io/KDEBlog/posts/QML%20%E5%AE%89%E5%8D%93%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E6%9E%84%E5%BB%BA%E4%B8%8E%E8%BF%90%E8%A1%8C.html#building-qml-android-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building and Running QML Android Applications | Blog</a></p>
<h2>Week 3, July 15th to July 21st</h2>
<p>During this week, I officially began the migration work for Blinken.</p>
<p>After studying Blinken's source code, I found that the interface of Blinken is drawn by a class named Blinken, which spans over 1000 lines. The drawing logic involves manipulating elements from Blinken.svg and using QPainter for direct drawing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, QML does not provide built-in support for manipulating SVG images like QtWidgets. Therefore, I split the SVG images into separate files and assembled these elements using QML with Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Modifying the UI took longer than I anticipated. However, after a week, I have nearly completed the interface drawing for Blinken. Next steps involve refining some page details and migrating Blinken's logic over.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that QML does not provide a non-rectangular MouseArea for use, requiring the creation of a custom class to achieve this functionality. Fortunately, an example for this existed in earlier versions of the documentation: <a href="https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtdeclarative.git/tree/examples/quick/customitems/maskedmousearea?h=6.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maskedmousearea example</a>. Although this example seems to have been removed in the latest version, it should still be feasible to implement based on reference.</p>

<h2>Project Introduction</h2>
<p>The description of the KDE project: <a href="https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/org/prodetail/24b5c0531?list=org&amp;navpage=org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porting KDE Games to Android platform</a> is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KDE Games and educational games are integral parts of the KDE Gear suite. Very few applications are currently operational on platforms other than Linux, such as Android. The supported applications can be viewed at <a href="https://apps.kde.org/platforms/android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://apps.kde.org/platforms/android</a>. Consequently, we plan to port some of these games to Android, specifically supporting architectures like arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64. The ultimate goal is to distribute their Android versions through apps.kde.org, F-Droid, Google Store, etc.</p>
<p>Candidates for porting include Kajongg, KMahjongg, KShisen, Kigo, Blinken, Klickety, Skladnik, Kbounce, Kollision, KSudoku, KTurtle, Picmi, and Klines. You can learn about their features and code at apps.kde.org or invent.kde.org.</p>
<p>Finally, you will port one or more of these games to Android and facilitate community efforts to distribute them through software stores.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In simple terms, the project involves porting some KDE games to the Android platform, as these games are currently only available on the Linux platform. If you use Ubuntu, you can install and run a game with the following commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>sudo apt install Kollision</li>
<li>kollision</li>
</ol>
<p>Available games include Kajongg, KMahjongg, KShisen, Kigo, Blinken, Klickety, Skladnik, Kbounce, Kollision, KSudoku, KTurtle, Picmi, and Klines. However, for the completion of the project, porting just one game is sufficient.</p>
<h2>My Application Experience</h2>
<p>When I first saw this project, it was quite late, with less than a week before the application deadline. Before that, I had already written an application for another project. However, after seeing this project, I felt it was more appealing to me. Unfortunately, at that time, I was preparing for an exam, so I had only two days left to write the application.</p>
<p>After pulling an all-nighter, I submitted my application and listed this project as my first choice. Finally, on June 26, I received an email confirming that my application had been accepted.</p>
<h2>Reason for Applying</h2>
<p>Since my primary programming language is C++, I chose this project from the list of C++ projects. Compared to other projects, I found this one more interesting.</p>
<p>Initially, I did not know that this was KDE community's first participation in OSPP, nor did I know it was their first and only project. I also wasn't familiar with the KDE community. After learning about the KDE community, I discovered that I really liked their philosophy. The mentor was also very enthusiastic and emphasized the importance of communication multiple times during the application process, providing me with a lot of help.</p>
<h2>Project Development Plan</h2>
<p>The project uses QML to port the applications to Android. In simple terms, the process is divided into the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure the development environment.</li>
<li>Create a QtQuick project and start the migration:
<ol>
<li>Implement the UI.</li>
<li>Port the logic code.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Package, deploy, and test.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, I have roughly completed the work of configuring the environment.</p>
<p>Since I only have a Windows machine at the moment, my solution is to run a Fedora Workstation 40 virtual machine using VirtualBox. In the virtual machine, I use podman and distrobox to set up the KDE development environment with the KDE kdesrc-build tool.</p>
